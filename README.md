## 📖 Skills and Knowledge
My skillset is very broad but somewhat shallow (wide-T profile). However this allows me to rapidly adapt to new workflows and tools as needed.

Below is a self-assessed list of my skills where:
- 🟢 High means I am comfortable and confident using this
- 🟠 Med means I am reasonably confident but will often refer to documentation
- 🔴 Low means I am not confident and rely heavily on documentation
